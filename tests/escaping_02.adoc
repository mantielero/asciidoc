A word or phrase between single pluses, such as +/user/{id}+,
is not substituted.
However, the special characters like +<+ and +>+ are still
escaped in the output.

An attribute reference within a word, such as dev++{conf}++,
is not replaced.

A plus passthrough will escape standalone formatting marks,
like +``+, or formatting marks within a word, like all-natural++*++.
